This is a project that I want to work on next.<br>
It will be an AI waifu assistant, with 3D model at the bottom right corner of screen. It will be able to do some automated tasks and keep you accompany<br>
Current goals to do:
- Actually add chat history
- Add 3D avatar
- Get Speech to text working (it is implemented, but doesn't work)
- Get Text to Speech working (in Rust it ain't that easy okay...)
- Automate some tasks
- Provide ability to view screen for AI
- Link it to YT/Twitch chat
